gdns
====

gdns is a dns proxy server.
I've shamelessly forked this from github.com/fangdingjun and added a few tweaks to:
 1) make it usable as a library and 
 1) support wildcard hosts (route *.foo.bar to a particular IP) 


features
=======

- support forward the query by rule,
     different domains use different upstream server
- support ip black list
- support google https dns
- support wildcard hosts 

usage
=====
    
    TODO
